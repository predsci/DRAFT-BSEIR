Description: Fits epidemic data to and generates stochastic profiles of a model with constant or time-dependent behavior modification parameters. Two parameters, p and q, describe the effect of reduced contact rate of susceptible and infectious populations, respectively. In the absence of behavior modification p=q=1 and we recover the familiar compartmental Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered (SIR) equations. 'DRAFT' supports both constant values for p and q and a time-dependent form which smoothly changes p and q from their initial, pre-epidemic value of 1.0 to the user chosen values that are between 0 and 1. The start and transient time of behavior change are set by the user. 'DRAFT' can be used to compare forecasts of epidemic incidence with and without behavior modification.
