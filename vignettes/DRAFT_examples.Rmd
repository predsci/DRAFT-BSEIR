## Examples
This document contains a series of examples using the runDRAFT() function.  The objectives of these examples are to demonstrate the requied format of input incidence data and show how varying inputs activate different models and forecasts.

### Example 1
This example fits an SIR model to 2017-2018 San Diego County laboratory-confirmed cases of influenza.  



```{r}
library(DRAFT)
# San Diego 2017-2018 data is included in package as 
# 'incidence_data1'
head(incidence_data1)

# we will fit data to an SIR model (no behavior terms).
# 1-SIR, 2-SEIR, 3-behavior SIR 
epi_model = 1
# the population is about 3 million
pop = 3e6
# Set disease generation time in days
Tg = 2.6
# latent period in days - needed only for SEIR model 
# (epi_model = 2)
sigma = NULL
# Parameters for behavior modification model only
dp = dq = ts = dL = NULL

```

To run DRAFT, execute the following line in an R console.  It will take a minute or two to execute the MCMC fitting procedure.  The function will create a subdirectory of the current working directory and save the resulting .RData and .png files there.  For more details see the runDRAFT help page \code{?runDRAFT}.

```{r, eval=F}
results <- runDRAFT(inc_data=incidence_data1, epi_model=epi_model, pop=pop, Tg=Tg, dp=dp, dq=dq, ts=ts, dL=dL)
```
```{r}
# view results in subdirectory
paste0("user_data_", Sys.Date(), "_Tg_", Tg, "/")
```

<!-- ![Results from Example 1.](`paste0("user_data_", Sys.Date(), "_Tg_2.6")`) -->
<!-- ![Results from Example 1.](user_data_2019-05-02_Tg_2.6/results-user_data-42.png) -->



### Example 2
We now do a fit to the data and then generate a forecast for the following weeks.  The data is similar to example 1, but with 2013-2014 San Diego County laboratory-confirmed cases of influenza.


```{r}
# San Diego 2013-2014 data is included in package as 'incidence_data2'
head(incidence_data2)

# notice the additional dates at the end of the dataframe with cases=NA.  DRAFT will use the non-NA points to fit a model and then run the model forward to create a forecast for all NA entries.
incidence_data2[28:41, ]

# we will fit data to an SIR model (no behavior terms).
# 1 - SIR, 2 - SEIR, 3 - behavior SIR 
epi_model = 1
# the population is about 3 million
pop = 3e6
# Set disease generation time in days
Tg = 2.6
# latent period in days - needed only for SEIR model, epi_model = 2
sigma = NULL
# Parameters for behavior modification model only
dp = dq = ts = dL = NULL

```

To run DRAFT, execute the following line in an R console.  It will take a minute or two to execute the MCMC fitting procedure.  The function will create a subdirectory of the current working directory and save the resulting .RData and .png files there.  For more details see the runDRAFT help page \code{?runDRAFT}.

```{r, eval=F}
results <- runDRAFT(inc_data=incidence_data2, epi_model=epi_model, pop=pop, Tg=Tg, dp=dp, dq=dq, ts=ts, dL=dL)
```
```{r}
# view results in subdirectory
paste0("user_data_", Sys.Date(), "_Tg_", Tg, "/")
```



### Example 3
This example fits an SIR model with behavior modification to 2014 Ebola data from Liberia.

```{r}
# Liberia 2014 data is included in the DRAFT package as 'incidence_data3'. 
head(incidence_data3)

# No weeks are specified for forecasting
tail(incidence_data3)

# we will fit data to an SIR model with behavior terms.
# 1 - SIR, 2 - SEIR, 3 - behavior SIR 
epi_model = 3
# the population is about 4 million
pop = 4035777
# Set disease generation time in days
Tg = 12
# latent period in days - needed only for SEIR model
sigma = NULL
# Setting the contact rate modifications for Susceptible and Infected to NULL will cause these parameters to be fit.
dp = dq = NULL
# Behavior modifications are known to have commenced at the end of July 2014.
ts = as.Date("2014-07-30")
# It took approximately 20 days for the changes to fully take hold.
dL = 20
```

To run DRAFT, execute the following line in an R console.  It will take a minute or two to execute the MCMC fitting procedure.  The function will create a subdirectory of the current working directory and save the resulting .RData and .png files there.  For more details see the runDRAFT help page \code{?runDRAFT}.

```{r, eval=F}
results <- runDRAFT(inc_data=incidence_data3, epi_model=epi_model, pop=pop, Tg=Tg, dp=dp, dq=dq, ts=ts, dL=dL)
```
```{r}
# view results in subdirectory
paste0("user_data_", Sys.Date(), "_Tg_", Tg, "/")
```


### Example 4
This example fits an SIR model with behavior modifications to 2014 Ebola data from Liberia and forecasts the following weeks.


```{r}
# Liberia 2014 data is included in the DRAFT package as 'incidence_data4'. 
head(incidence_data4)

# Several weeks have been marked for forecasting (cases=NA)
incidence_data4[34:40, ]

# we will fit data to an SIR model with behavior terms.
# 1 - SIR, 2 - SEIR, 3 - behavior SIR 
epi_model = 3
# the population is about 4 million
pop = 4035777
# Set disease generation time in days
Tg = 12
# latent period in days - needed only for SEIR model, epi_model = 2
sigma = NULL
# When forecast periods are requested the contact rate modifications for Susceptible and Infected must be set by the user. These values indicate that the initial contact rate for susceptibles will be multiplied by a factor of 1-dp and the initial contact rate of infectious is multiplied by a factor of 1-dq.
dp = 0.002
dq = 0.45
# Behavior modifications are known to have commenced at the end of July 2014.
ts = as.Date("2014-07-30")
# It took approximately 20 days for the changes to fully take hold.
dL = 20
```

To run DRAFT, execute the following line in an R console.  It will take a minute or two to execute the MCMC fitting procedure.  The function will create a subdirectory of the current working directory and save the resulting .RData and .png files there.  For more details see the runDRAFT help page \code{?runDRAFT}.

```{r, eval=F}
results <- runDRAFT(inc_data=incidence_data4, epi_model=epi_model, pop=pop, Tg=Tg, dp=dp, dq=dq, ts=ts, dL=dL)
```
```{r}
# view results in subdirectory
paste0("user_data_", Sys.Date(), "_Tg_", Tg, "/")
```



### Example 5
This example is similar to example 3 except it fits an SEIR model to 2014 Ebola data from Liberia.


```{r}
# Liberia 2014 data is included in the DRAFT package as 'incidence_data4'. 
head(incidence_data3)

# we will fit data to an SIR model with behavior terms.
# 1 - SIR, 2 - SEIR, 3 - behavior SIR 
epi_model = 2
# the population is about 4 million
pop = 4035777
# Set disease generation time in days
Tg = 17
# latent period in days - needed only for SEIR model, epi_model = 2
sigma = 5
# Parameters for behavior modification model only
dp = dq = ts = dL = NULL
```
